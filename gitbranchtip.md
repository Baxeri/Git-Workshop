If you are managing a Git repo in a group, it's encouraged to name the
branches properly, so they can people can tell them apart easier.
So don't name new branches with just "new-feature" or "bug-fix".

It's better to sign them with your initials and also name them with the
feature you added or bugfix you implemented. For example:
git checkout -b jku/bug-fix-usermanagement
