If you're in a rush and don't focus on writing words correct, you can utilize
the autocorrect command:
git config --global help.autocorrect <integer>

The integer part of the command dictates how long the program waits to run
the command, so if for example you put 30, it waits 3 seconds for it to run,
so if you wrote the wrong command you can abort it.
